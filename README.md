# Description
`image-utility` is a really light and easy to use cli tools to do some basic image-processing like 
resize, rotate, blur without the need to open a heavy software like GIMP, I decided
to make the program the more intuitive possible so unlike some other cli tools.
This one will ask the parameters of the action you want to do after you have selected.

What does it mean? It means that you don't have to type a long line like `image-utility path path2 resize dim1 dim2`
It will ask more information once you have selected an action so you don't have to remember a lot of things to use this program
There also a link at the end when the processing is done to rapidly view the result of the operation
